# Bees Algorithm

- [Bees algorithm (BA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bees_algorithm) is a population-based search algorithm which was developed by Pham, Ghanbarzadeh et al. in 2005, and can be used for both combinatorial optimization and continuous optimization.
- My implementation contains basic interfaces for using this algorithm for any optimization problem
- In ```clique``` folder I used BA to solve [maximum graph clique problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem)
- Also implemented basic procedure to find the best algorithm configuration for any given problem in ```optimize.py```
